I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student studying computer science and technology at [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm) where I am advised by [Prof. Ruiquan Ge(葛瑞泉)](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/grq/main.htm) and [Prof. Changmiao Wang (王昌淼)](https://www.sribd.cn/teacher/505). I have a broad interest in Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis, with a primary focus on Biomedical Imaging.
